Project: clock-display
Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class ClockDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the object inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as timeTick and setTime. Watch the 
"displayString" in the inspector.

The displayString field simulates the actual clock display device. Were this 
program running in a real clock, it would change the real, physical display 
hardware instead of this string. The timeTick method would be triggered once 
every minute by some timer hardware.

Everything else could be pretty much the same.


Note: This project does not implement adequate handling of errors.


1. diagram are in the object folders 

2. every time we add or remove a class from the prgram , then we will see a change in the square in the class diagram 

3. every time we change a parameter , value, or add and delete a object and  etc . it will show the changed values in the object diagram 

4. private instructer tutor;

5.  it doesnt reach the limit 

6. every time the min resets we add 1 to the hours 

7. ; if telling to do smt 

8. when its over the limit the value dosent change
